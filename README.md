# 🧪 Assignment — Class Enrollment API (Instructions Only)

> **Goal:** Build a backend API using **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **middleware** by following the steps below.
>
> ⚠️ This assignment is **instruction-only**. You must write the code yourself.

---

## 📌 Scenario

You are building a **Class Enrollment backend API**.

The system tracks:

* students
* courses
* enrollment records

Data alrea dy exists in MongoDB. Your job is to **connect to it, expose it via routes, and add middleware**.

---

## Part 1 — Project Setup

1. Initialize a new Node.js project
2. Install required packages:

   * `express`
   * `mongoose`
3. Set up a basic Express server
4. Ensure the server starts without errors

---

## Part 2 — MongoDB (Import Data First)

You are provided with a JSON file containing enrollment data.

Your tasks:

1. Start MongoDB
2. Import the provided JSON file into a database called **`schoolDB`**
3. Verify that a collection named **`enrollments`** exists
4. Confirm that documents are visible using MongoDB Compass or shell

You should **not** modify the data structure.

---

## Part 3 — Mongoose Model (Add This First)

Before writing routes, you will now introduce **one Mongoose model**.

> This helps structure data access and prepares you for more complex applications later.

### Your tasks

1. Create a `models` folder
2. Create a file for the enrollment model
3. Define a schema that represents an enrollment record

The model **must include** at least:

* student name
* course name
* enrollment status
* enrollment date

```
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const enrollmentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  studentName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true
  },

  courseName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true
  },

  status: {
    type: String,
    default: "enrolled"
  },

  enrolledAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
});

export default mongoose.model("Enrollment", enrollmentSchema);

```

---

## Part 4 — Express Routes Using the Model

Once the model is created, build routes that use it.

### Required Routes

You must implement:

* `GET /enrollments`

  * Fetch all enrollment records from MongoDB

* `GET /enrollments/:id`

  * Fetch a single enrollment by ID
  * Return an error if not found

All database access must:

* use the Mongoose model
* use `async/await`

---

## Part 5 — Middleware

Once routes are working, add middleware.

### 1️⃣ Custom Logger Middleware

* Logs the HTTP method and URL for every request
* Must call `next()`

### 2️⃣ Error-Handling Middleware

* Catches all errors passed using `next(err)`
* Sends a JSON response
* Uses appropriate HTTP status codes

> Reminder: Error middleware must be added **after** routes.

---

##  Part 6 — Error Scenarios to Handle

Your API must correctly handle:

1. Requesting an enrollment ID that does not exist
2. Invalid enrollment ID format
3. Database or connection errors

Errors must:

* NOT crash the server
* Return JSON (not HTML)

---

## 🧠 Reflection Questions (Answer in README)

1. Why do database operations require `async/await`?
2. What happens if you forget to call `next(err)`?
3. Why is error middleware placed at the end?
